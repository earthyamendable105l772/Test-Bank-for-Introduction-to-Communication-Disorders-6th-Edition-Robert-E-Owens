Each chapter is concise, yet comprehensive–striking a just right balance of information appropriate for introductory-level students. Readers gain a basic foundation in the areas of anatomy and physiology of speech and hearing, and an overview of the various disorders that affect voice, fluency, articulation, language, cognition, swallowing, and hearing across the lifespan. Updated case studies, evidence-based practice summary boxes, and new medically based photographs help students bridge the gap between theory and clinical application.
